# Changelog

The application version is independent of portable record `schemaVersion`.

## 0.13.1 — 2026-11-01

- DocumentViewer now uses the shared full-window overlay frame.
- Fix the folder settings drawer losing its accessible name after the dock toggle was added (the toggle moved into the drawer body).

## 0.13.0 — 2026-11-01

- Fix non-game folders in game projects showing a bare name/path card; every folder page now shares the details / subfolders / files frame.
- Add one-level CELL groups with an inner editing mode.
- Refactor: RightPanel frame, shared overlay-frame, FileMenu and ViewToggle components, shared UI test harness.

## 0.12.0 — 2026-11-01

- Folder settings can be docked as a tab in the right panel (content | settings) with a per-project preference; narrow windows fall back to the drawer.

## 0.11.1 — 2026-11-01

- Fix the game cover cell and image cells not filling their container when resized; add an image fit option (fill/crop or show whole) with fill as the default for game covers.

## 0.11.0 — 2026-11-01

- Queue panel: the toolbar badge is no longer clipped, both tabs share list/image views, auto-advance is an icon toggle, and counts read "N items" / "N files".
- Add a game cover image URL import (preview, confirm, portable asset) with main-process download limits that reject private addresses, credentials, unsupported content and oversized files.
- Add the "game cover" base cell for game projects in the block editor.
- Add DLsite as a metadata source (exact product URL; FANZA is not supported).
- File context menu with file info; friendly file type names; aligned folder text in the reader toolbar; pagination buttons get accessible names; narrow media toolbars can switch the display mode from the more-options menu.
- Remove the obsolete media-ui test and stale video-viewer queue assertions.

## 0.10.0 — 2026-11-01

- Queue: single click only plays (unqueued files are trial playback); right-click, Ctrl/Shift multi-select and Shift+arrows add to the queue; the queue entry moves to the top toolbar; the queue panel offers list and image views.
- Fix the mini player moving the native window when dragged over the title bar.
- Add a collapsed folder-details section and a shared subfolder list across media and manga pages.
- Archive legacy POC and stage documents under docs/archive; add CLAUDE.md for Claude Code.
- Commit previously pending game-detection, navigation and App changes.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-10-30

- Add a unified media workspace with source-aware cross-folder browsing, collapsible source groups and virtualized file layouts.
- Add shared audio/video playback, cross-project mixed queues, independent duplicate entries, drag ordering, removal and optional auto-advance.
- Add a draggable in-app mini player with edge snapping, background playback and playback continuity across project and window changes.
- Add MP3 playback and embedded artwork extraction; fix StrictMode source cleanup that left music duration at zero and playback unresponsive.
- Display audio volume on a 0–100 scale and improve the visibility of unfilled slider tracks across themes.
- Share folder back/forward history across panes and accept both native and DOM mouse side-button events with duplicate suppression.
- Add per-project conversion previews, atomic backups and original-category restoration; preserve project/folder identity, templates and original media.
- Retire legacy categories from project creation while keeping compatible reads and applicable single-file previews.
- Keep unsupported files visible without opening unsupported full-screen previews; retain queue transitions, source validation and file visibility controls.
- Refine Agent task batching, focused reading and verification rules; expand controlled-data and Electron UI regression coverage.

Known follow-ups: S9–S12 cover manual-only queue addition, folder-details presentation, queue UI redesign and mini-player dragging near the native title bar. These requests are recorded but are not included as implemented fixes. Physical mouse drivers, sound output and other platforms still require user acceptance.

Portable record `schemaVersion` remains 1. Optional `mediaSourceCategory` preserves legacy template selection during conversion. No bulk scan, migration or cleanup of actual user collections accompanies this release.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-10-29

- Consolidate folder/file tools, expose CARD controls inline and add persistent TABLE column visibility.
- Redesign saved searches with inline creation, matching and deletion while preserving stable query identities.
- Add status badges, rating/progress displays, field-value copying and conditional CELL content using existing field types.
- Correct palette and canvas drag coordinates; improve editor and folder-settings layout and shared overlay backgrounds.
- Add explicit game launch defaults, application/file and URL actions, per-action arguments, contextual settings and drag ordering.
- Fix shared reader hit areas, directional navigation, page selection and zoom reset; preserve manga work boundaries in file overview.
- Add confirmed field deletion and full project-data removal with impact previews, verified external backups and guarded recovery.
- Streamline Agent instructions and task navigation; add controlled data and Electron regression coverage.

Portable record schemaVersion remains 1 with optional validated capabilities. Original media is retained; no actual collection migration or scan accompanies this release. Music playback, nested containers and native macOS game launching remain deferred.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-10-29

- Add dark, glass-white and paper themes, five UI languages, shared SVG icons and system-language defaults.
- Add a paged, virtualized file overview with thumbnails, source grouping, full-path lists and source-aware previews.
- Fix large file-list scroll crashes caused by deferred event access; show an empty state for filters with no matches.
- Add read-only ZIP/CBZ image reading and the native Chromium PDF viewer without extracting or modifying original documents.
- Add static-text, spacer and cached system-information components, plus boolean, enum, URL and date-only fields.
- Add layout creation, copying, renaming, deletion, draft protection, undo/redo and per-folder assignment to project schemes.
- Add settings export/import with an explicit allowlist, difference previews, merge/replace modes and recoverable backups.
- Expand metadata selection to 11 grouped, no-key sources with provenance, fill/replace previews and manual-value protection; exclude IGDB and TMDB.
- Redesign video controls with hover volume, inline subtitle groups, playback speed, fullscreen and optional cancellable auto-next.
- Add stable saved-query field identities and numeric/date comparisons; preserve ambiguous legacy queries for explicit review.
- Strengthen embedded NW.js/WOLF runtime boundaries and ancestor protection; refactor validation, playback and search-index synchronization.
- Add controlled-data and Electron UI regression coverage, including image/video lists with 1,200 files each.

Portable record `schemaVersion` remains 1. No bulk migration or scan of actual user collections is performed by this version bump.

Known limitations: live metadata-site/login access, media-format and game-engine variants still need real samples. Native macOS game launching is not implemented. Music playback, cloud sync and nested component groups remain deferred. See `docs/WORK_ITEMS.md`.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-10-27

- Add group renaming, drag ordering and contextual hover actions in the project sidebar.
- Synchronize CARD/TABLE/TREE folder locations with backslash breadcrumbs; add draggable TABLE columns and collapsible TREE branches.
- Refine CARD display controls, folder settings tabs and advanced data-management options.
- Add CELL dividers, Delete-key removal, multiple optional image slots and clearer field/component palettes.
- Keep manga content layouts independent of CARD layouts; add validated Steam metadata preview/import alongside E-Hentai.
- Add project-removal previews, verified local recovery copies and safe cleanup of unused empty root metadata; preserve shared data, other projects and original media.
- Improve recreation/relink errors around missing folder records and archived project settings without silently replacing recoverable identities.
- Extend recognized game-runtime layouts and ancestor-boundary protection, including nested Tyrano deployments and macOS app bundles.
- Add progressive album/manga content loading, viewport-based gallery rendering and asynchronous thumbnail decoding over scoped media streams.
- Prioritize cached thumbnails, coalesce duplicate work, skip cancelled queued jobs and throttle cache maintenance; stabilize image geometry while scrolling.
- Improve manga fullscreen reading, zoom/pan, page selection and spread transitions; keep navigation icons fixed when RTL key bindings change.
- Add per-project video autoplay preferences, release playback sources on navigation and combine subtitle settings under an icon-only video settings menu.
- Remove resume prompts and full-video control shading; support horizontal mouse-wheel scrolling in the video strip.
- Simplify folder search, move advanced controls out of the primary flow and reduce routine success notifications.
- Remove the default TITLE field from new projects, retain existing data and expose F12 DevTools access.
- Update focused documentation and controlled-data regression, reader and gallery-performance coverage.

Portable record `schemaVersion` remains 1. No bulk migration of user collections is performed by this version bump.

Known limitations: some embedded NW.js and unpacked/mixed WOLF RPG layouts remain unrecognized. Native macOS game launching is not implemented; app-bundle detection does not imply launch support. See `docs/WORK_ITEMS.md` for outstanding work.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-10-27

- Add CARD-only layout presets and display controls, with multi-level/all-depth and single-level browsing.
- Keep TREE branches visible when opening content; retain folder-by-folder navigation in TABLE.
- Add independent content panes, persistent visibility, a root-content default and separate folder settings.
- Refine sidebar drag ordering, hover actions, combined settings and a neutral bottom create command.
- Separate folder selection from project creation; order the form by name, category, folder and group.
- Check folder records and game boundaries before navigation; never create records as a navigation side effect.
- Restore the game cover, custom actions and field-table layout.
- Add Chromium thumbnail decoding fallback, coalesced requests, recoverable caches and original-image fallback; extend image recognition to BMP, AVIF and ICO.
- Normalize fractional resize values before validating and saving workspace preferences.
- Exclude case-renamed metadata directories from all-depth scans on Windows.
- Preserve legacy scan limits until explicitly expanded; add optional, backward-compatible project/display preferences without bulk migration.
